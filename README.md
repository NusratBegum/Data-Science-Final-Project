# Air Quality Analysis Using Real-Time Data Collection
```Update: 18 February 2025```

# Objective
In this project, students will explore real-time air quality data, collect it daily, analyze trends, and derive meaningful insights. The project is designed to enhance students' skills in data collection, hypothesis formulation, data analysis, and visualization.

# Project Tasks
1. Define Hypotheses
  - Students must first identify what they want to investigate using air quality data.
  - They should set up at least two hypotheses, either sequentially (one hypothesis leading to another) or two separate ones addressing different aspects of air quality.
  - Examples of Hypotheses:
    i. Example 1: “Air pollution levels in Bangkok are higher during weekdays than weekends due to traffic emissions.”
    ii. Example 2: “PM2.5 levels in cities located in valleys or basins can be higher due to the trapping of pollutants by surrounding mountains.”

2. Daily Data Collection
  - Students should modify the provided Python code ([link](https://mycourses.ict.mahidol.ac.th/mod/folder/view.php?id=13912)) to collect air quality data from different cities of interest based on their hypotheses.
  - Students must adapt the script to gather daily data from now until the end of the course (April 30).
    i. Automating the data collection process is encouraged (e.g., using cron jobs, scheduled scripts, or cloud-based execution).

3. Data Preparation and Analysis
  - Students must clean, organize, and structure the collected data for analysis.
  - Students must apply appropriate statistical techniques, visualizations, and machine learning models (as covered in this course) to test their hypotheses.

4. Present Findings
  - Students must conclude and present their interesting findings.
  - Students must explain the steps they took to obtain those insights.

# Guidance on Formulating Good Hypotheses and Insights
A good hypothesis should lead to insights that support better decision-making. For example, identifying pollution patterns can help recommend healthier commuting times or suggest policy changes to reduce emissions. Students should focus on findings that provide actionable recommendations rather than just observations.

# Submission
1. A PPTX slide for a 10-minute presentation.
2. A two-column report (in a PDF file) summarizing their methodology, analysis, and findings (maximum two pages, excluding references). Please include the code that you use for each find in the appendix. The report should include the followings:
  - Introduction and hypotheses
  - Data collection and preparation
  - Methodology
  - Insights and Discussion
  - Conclusions

# Grading Criteria
TBD.
